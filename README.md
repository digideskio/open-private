Open in Private Browsing Mode
=============================

Imagine you come across a link online that you'd like to look at, but would
rather do so in [Private Browsing mode][pb]?

This add-on will add an option to Firefox's right-click menu. Just right-click
on a link and select "Open in Private Browsing mode", and Firefox will switch
to Private Browsing and automatically open the link you selected.

What is this useful for?
* You click around Amazon, and suddenly you see an item that you think would
  make a great gift for your partner, who uses the same computer.
* You encounter an ad for a really silly item that you really want to check
  out but are too embarrassed to admit.
* Your detour through the depths of Wikipedia gets so absurd that you'd rather
  not have those pages show up in your browsing history.
* etc. etc.
